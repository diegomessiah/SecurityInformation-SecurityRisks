# Common Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

## Introduction
Security involves protecting organizations and individuals from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Understanding the current threat landscape enables organizations to create effective policies and processes to prevent and mitigate security issues.

## Risk Management
A primary goal of organizations is to protect assets, which can be digital or physical. 

### Examples of Digital Assets:
- Social Security Numbers (SSNs)
- Dates of birth
- Bank account numbers
- Mailing addresses

### Examples of Physical Assets:
- Payment kiosks
- Servers
- Desktop computers
- Office spaces

### Risk Management Strategies:
1. **Acceptance**: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity.
2. **Avoidance**: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether.
3. **Transference**: Transferring risk to a third party.
4. **Mitigation**: Lessening the impact of a known risk.

Organizations implement risk management processes based on established frameworks, such as the NIST Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF) and Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST).

## Common Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

### Threats
A threat is any circumstance that can negatively impact assets. Common threats include:
- **Insider Threats**: Authorized personnel abusing access to harm the organization.
- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: Threat actors maintaining unauthorized access over time.

### Risks
A risk affects the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Factors influencing risks include:
- **External Risks**: Threats from outside the organization.
- **Internal Risks**: Risks posed by current or former employees or vendors.
- **Legacy Systems**: Old systems that may not be updated.
- **Multiparty Risks**: Risks from third-party vendors accessing sensitive data.
- **Software Compliance**: Risks from outdated or non-compliant software.

### Vulnerabilities
A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by threats. Common vulnerabilities include:
- **ProxyLogon**: Affects Microsoft Exchange servers.
- **ZeroLogon**: Flaw in Microsoftâ€™s Netlogon authentication.
- **Log4Shell**: Allows remote attackers to run malicious code.
- **PetitPotam**: Exploits NTLM authentication.
- **Security Logging Failures**: Insufficient monitoring capabilities.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery**: Manipulating server-side applications.

### Importance of Vulnerability Management
Entry-level analysts may work in vulnerability management, monitoring systems to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Continuous monitoring is vital, as unpatched systems remain vulnerable to intrusions.
