# Key Concepts in Security Analysis

## Threats
- **Definition**: Events or circumstances that can negatively impact assets.
- **Example**: Social engineering attacks, such as phishing, where attackers manipulate individuals to gain sensitive information.

## Risks
- **Definition**: The likelihood that a threat will occur, affecting the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
- **Example**: Lack of backup protocols that could lead to data loss.

## Asset Risk Levels
- **Low-Risk Asset**: Public information (e.g., website content).
- **Medium-Risk Asset**: Non-public info that could cause moderate damage (e.g., early earnings reports).
- **High-Risk Asset**: Sensitive data protected by regulations (e.g., PII or intellectual property).

## Vulnerabilities
- **Definition**: Weaknesses that can be exploited by threats.
- **Examples**: Outdated software, weak passwords, and unprotected confidential data.

## Role of Analysts
- **Educate Employees**: Train staff to identify threats like phishing.
- **Physical Security**: Use access controls to secure physical assets.
- **Monitoring and Reporting**: Encourage reporting of suspicious activities and monitor access to critical assets.

It is crucial to continually address vulnerabilities to minimize risks and protect an organizationâ€™s assets.
