# OWASP Security Principles

## 1. Minimize the Attack Surface Area
- **What It Means:** Reduce the number of points where attackers can try to access your systems.
- **Practical Example:** If a web application has several features, but only a few are used, disable the unused ones. For instance, if a feature for importing data isn’t being utilized, turn it off to eliminate that potential entry point for attackers.
- **Implementation Tip:** Conduct regular assessments of your applications to identify and disable unnecessary features or services.

## 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- **What It Means:** Users should have the minimum permissions necessary to perform their job functions.
- **Practical Example:** In a financial organization, an employee in accounts payable should only access financial records relevant to their tasks and not have access to sensitive data like payroll.
- **Implementation Tip:** Use role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that employees are granted permissions based on their job roles. Regularly review these permissions.

## 3. Defense in Depth
- **What It Means:** Use multiple layers of security measures to protect your organization.
- **Practical Example:** Implement a combination of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption. For example, if a user tries to access a sensitive document, they must first log in (authentication), and then pass through a firewall that checks their access rights.
- **Implementation Tip:** Deploy different security controls at various levels (network, application, and data) to ensure that if one layer fails, others will still provide protection.

## 4. Separation of Duties
- **What It Means:** Divide responsibilities among multiple individuals to reduce the risk of fraud and error.
- **Practical Example:** In a company, the person who processes invoices should not be the same person who approves payments. This ensures that no single individual can commit fraud without detection.
- **Implementation Tip:** Establish clear roles and responsibilities for sensitive tasks and ensure that no one person has complete control over any critical process.

## 5. Keep Security Simple
- **What It Means:** Avoid overly complicated security measures that can confuse users or become unmanageable.
- **Practical Example:** Implementing a user-friendly password manager for employees to generate and store strong passwords instead of requiring them to remember complex password rules.
- **Implementation Tip:** Regularly review your security policies and controls to eliminate unnecessary complexity, making them easier for users to understand and follow.

## 6. Fix Security Issues Correctly
- **What It Means:** When vulnerabilities are identified, they must be resolved effectively and tested to ensure they don’t reoccur.
- **Practical Example:** If a vulnerability is found in software, not only should the software be patched, but the root cause should also be identified and addressed to prevent future occurrences.
- **Implementation Tip:** Establish a clear incident response process that includes identifying the cause, fixing it, and validating the fix through testing.

## 7. Use Secure Defaults
- **What It Means:** Systems should be configured with security in mind right from the start, using secure settings as the default.
- **Practical Example:** When deploying a new web application, ensure that all configurations prioritize security—such as disabling default accounts, enforcing strong password policies, and enabling logging and monitoring by default.
- **Implementation Tip:** Create a checklist of secure settings that must be applied to all systems during the deployment process. Regularly review and update this checklist to align with current security best practices.
