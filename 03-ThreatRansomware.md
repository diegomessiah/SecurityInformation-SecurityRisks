# Threat Ransomware

## Ransomware
Ransomware is a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. Once deployed, ransomware can:
- Freeze network systems
- Render devices unusable
- Encrypt or lock confidential data, making it inaccessible

The threat actor demands a ransom before providing a decryption key, similar to a password, to regain access to the data. Ransom negotiations or data leaks can occur through the dark web.

## The Web Layers
The web consists of three layers:
1. **Surface Web**: The layer most people use, containing content accessible through a web browser.
2. **Deep Web**: Generally requires authorization to access. Examples include an organization's intranet, accessible only by authorized users.
3. **Dark Web**: Accessible only with special software. It carries a negative connotation as it is often used for criminal activities due to its secrecy.

## Key Impacts of Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

### 1. Financial Impact
Compromised assets can lead to significant financial consequences, including:
- Interrupted production and services
- Costs to correct the issue
- Fines for non-compliance with laws and regulations

### 2. Identity Theft
Organizations must consider the risks of storing sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII). This data can be:
- Sold or leaked on the dark web
- Subject to risks due to the organization's data retention policies

### 3. Damage to Reputation
A solid customer base supports an organization's mission and financial goals. Impacts can include:
- Customers seeking competitors due to exploited vulnerabilities
- Bad press leading to permanent reputational damage
- Legal penalties and fines due to data breaches

Organizations are encouraged to implement robust security measures and follow protocols to mitigate these significant impacts. Utilizing all available tools, security teams can better prepare for events like ransomware attacks.
