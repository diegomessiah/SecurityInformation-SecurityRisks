# CIA Triad Overview

The CIA Triad is a foundational model in information security, guiding organizations in protecting their data and systems. It consists of three core principles:

## 1. Confidentiality
- **Definition**: Ensures that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals.
- **Key Practices**:
  - Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit.
  - Use access controls and permissions to limit data access.
  - Conduct regular training on data handling and privacy for employees.
- **Practical Example**: A healthcare organization encrypts patient records to ensure that only authorized medical personnel can access sensitive information, protecting patient confidentiality.

## 2. Integrity
- **Definition**: Guarantees the accuracy and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle.
- **Key Practices**:
  - Utilize checksums and hashing to verify data integrity.
  - Maintain audit trails and logs for critical data modifications.
  - Implement version control systems for documents and code.
- **Practical Example**: An online banking system uses hashing to ensure that transaction data has not been altered. If a transaction record shows a different amount than expected, it triggers an alert for further investigation.

## 3. Availability
- **Definition**: Ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed.
- **Key Practices**:
  - Deploy redundant systems and backups to prevent downtime.
  - Use load balancers and failover strategies to manage traffic.
  - Develop incident response plans to address potential service disruptions.
- **Practical Example**: A public transportation system maintains multiple servers to handle ticket sales. If one server fails, traffic is redirected to another server, ensuring that customers can still purchase tickets without disruption.

## Conclusion
The CIA Triad serves as a guiding framework for developing effective security policies and practices. By focusing on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, organizations can better protect their assets and respond to evolving threats.
