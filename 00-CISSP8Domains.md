# CISSP's Eight Security Domains

## 1. Security and Risk Management
- **Focus**: Establishing security governance and risk management.
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA triad)
  - Compliance and security policies
  - Risk management processes and creating a risk-aware culture

## 2. Asset Security
- **Focus**: Protecting organizational assets throughout their lifecycle.
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Asset classification and ownership
  - Privacy protection and data security controls
  - Data handling and storage procedures

## 3. Security Architecture and Engineering
- **Focus**: Designing and implementing secure systems and architectures.
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Secure system design principles
  - Security models and architecture frameworks
  - Vulnerabilities in hardware and software
  - Cryptographic systems and their applications

## 4. Communication and Network Security
- **Focus**: Securing network architecture and data communication.
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Network protocols and secure network components
  - Segmentation and boundary protection
  - Principles of secure communication channels

## 5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- **Focus**: Managing identity and access controls.
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - User provisioning and authentication methods
  - Access control models (RBAC, ABAC)
  - Account management and authorization processes

## 6. Security Assessment and Testing
- **Focus**: Evaluating security controls and their effectiveness.
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Security testing methodologies (vulnerability, penetration testing)
  - Compliance audits and assessment processes
  - Continuous monitoring and improvement

## 7. Security Operations
- **Focus**: Managing security operations and incident response.
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Incident response processes and operational security
  - Disaster recovery and business continuity planning
  - Security awareness training for personnel

## 8. Software Development Security
- **Focus**: Integrating security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Secure coding practices and software vulnerabilities
  - Application security testing and risk assessment
  - Incorporating security into design, development, and deployment phases

## Interconnection of Domains
The CISSP domains are interrelated, with each domain influencing and enhancing the others:
- **Security and Risk Management** sets the foundation for all other domains by defining policies and risk management strategies.
- **Asset Security** informs the **Security Architecture and Engineering** domain by identifying what needs protection.
- **Security Architecture and Engineering** ensures that the right security controls are in place for network communication, directly impacting **Communication and Network Security**.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** overlaps with **Security Operations**, as proper access controls are essential during incident response.
- **Security Assessment and Testing** helps to evaluate the effectiveness of controls implemented across all domains, ensuring a comprehensive security posture.
- **Software Development Security** relies on the principles established in the other domains to ensure secure coding practices and robust application security measures.
