# Overview of Security Controls

Security controls are essential safeguards implemented to reduce specific security risks within an organization. They play a critical role in protecting sensitive information and maintaining organizational integrity. This document outlines three common types of security controls: **encryption**, **authentication**, and **authorization**.

## Key Security Controls

### 1. Encryption
- **Definition**: The process of converting data from a readable format (plaintext) to an encoded format (ciphertext).
- **Purpose**: Ensures the confidentiality of sensitive data, such as customer account information and Social Security Numbers.
- **Process**:
  - Data is transformed into ciphertext, which is unreadable without decryption.
  - Decryption returns the data to its original plaintext form.

### 2. Authentication
- **Definition**: The process of verifying the identity of a user or system.
- **Basic Example**: Logging into a website using a username and password.
- **Advanced Methods**:
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Requires additional verification (e.g., security codes, biometrics).
  - **Biometric Authentication**: Uses unique physical characteristics like fingerprints, eye scans, or voice recognition.
- **Threats**: 
  - **Vishing**: A type of social engineering that exploits voice communication to steal sensitive information or impersonate individuals.

### 3. Authorization
- **Definition**: The process of granting access to specific resources within a system.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that individuals have permission to access certain data or systems.
- **Example**: An entry-level security analyst in the federal government may have authorized access to internal databases that are restricted to federal employees.

## Conclusion
These security controls are part of a broader security framework known as the **CIA triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Implementing these controls helps organizations mitigate risks and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and other threats.
