# Chapter: The Future of SIEM Tools

## 1. Introduction

In previous chapters, we explored Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools and their role in cybersecurity. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into how SIEM tools are used to protect organizational operations, and how they are evolving to meet the challenges posed by modern cyber threats.

## 2. Current SIEM Solutions

### 2.1 What is a SIEM Tool?

A **SIEM tool** is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities within an organization. SIEM tools provide **real-time monitoring** of security event logs and use this data to identify potential threats, risks, or vulnerabilities.

### 2.2 Dashboards in SIEM Tools

SIEM tools offer a variety of **dashboard options** to help cybersecurity teams manage and monitor organizational data. These dashboards allow security professionals to:

- View real-time security alerts.
- Analyze log data across multiple systems.
- Track the status of ongoing incidents.

However, most current SIEM solutions require **human interaction** for the analysis and response to security events.

## 3. The Future of SIEM Tools

### 3.1 Cloud-Hosted and Cloud-Native SIEM Tools

As cybersecurity evolves, so too does the need for **cloud functionality**. SIEM tools are increasingly being adapted to work in **cloud-hosted** and **cloud-native** environments.

- **Cloud-hosted SIEM tools**: Managed and maintained by vendors, these tools are accessed via the internet. They are ideal for organizations that prefer not to maintain their own infrastructure.
- **Cloud-native SIEM tools**: These tools are also vendor-managed but are designed to take full advantage of cloud computing features like **scalability**, **flexibility**, and **availability**.

### 3.2 Adapting to New Threats

As technology advances, SIEM tools must continue to evolve to counteract **new threat actor tactics** and **techniques**. Consider the increasing use of **Internet of Things (IoT)** devices, which expands the attack surface available to cybercriminals. This means more data is available for threat actors to exploit, making security management more complex.

### 3.3 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

The integration of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** in SIEM tools is expected to improve:

- **Threat identification**: AI can analyze vast amounts of data to detect suspicious activity more efficiently.
- **Dashboard visualization**: ML can automatically optimize the display of security events and anomalies, making it easier for analysts to interpret.
- **Data storage**: AI will improve how log data is indexed and retrieved, increasing the efficiency of future SIEM tools.

### 3.4 Automation and SOAR

The future of SIEM tools will increasingly involve **automation**. SIEM tools will integrate with **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)** platforms, which automate responses to common security incidents.

**Benefits of automation in SIEM tools**:
- **Faster incident response**: Automation allows many routine tasks to be handled without waiting for human intervention.
- **Streamlined operations**: Security analysts will have more time to focus on **complex** and **uncommon incidents**, while SOAR handles routine issues.

### 3.5 Interconnected Systems

The goal for the future is to have **cybersecurity platforms** and **tools** communicate seamlessly with one another. While the technology to enable this level of integration exists, it is still under development.
